# slmpy
Smart Local Moving community detection algorithm in Python and C++11/14, with fixed points.

**NOTE**: for now only Louvain is implemented. Check in later for more algorithms.

# References
The original Smart Local Moving algorithm is outlined in the *excellent* article:

  [Ludo Waltman](http://www.ludowaltman.nl/) and Nees Jan van Eck, "A smart local moving algorithm for large-scale modularity-based community detection", Eur. Phys. J. B (2013) 86: 471. DOI: [10.1140/epjb/e2013-40829-0](http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2013-40829-0)

The code is based on the wonderful Java version by deepminder: https://github.com/deepminder/SLM4J .
